# TODO

- [ ] Handle long lines, but try to avoid horizontal scrolling. Perhaps open long lines in a new instance of the editor, but split at a custom rune, then join the line at exit.
- [ ] Make it easier to spot the cursor when scrolling or searching.
- [ ] Have a "wrap around" toggle, for being able to write text and e-mails.
- [ ] Keep indentation when pasting a single line.
- [ ] Highlight the background of the active line.
- [ ] (maybe) Make the "smart dedentation" even smarter - let it consider the whitespace of the line above before dedenting.
- [ ] Screen recording at "ctrl-r" when in text mode. Render to PNG when in ASCII graphics mode.
- [ ] ctrl-w for regular text files should reflow the text.
